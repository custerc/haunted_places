In what was formerly a house, now a retail store, employees describe having the feeling of being watched, and often catching a glimpse of a figure in a hanging wall mirror. Also, the bells on the door chime on their own when no breeze or person is in the room. - May 2008 Update - The building where Buttons and Things was is now gone. It was demolished to make way for more retail progress in Freeport.\n",

And there was one death that did not happen in the school. Mimi, the reported spirit, died when the car she was in with her boyfriend backed into a snow bank, filling the exhaust pipe and causing carbon monoxide poisoning. So far the research has not been able to determine there have been no actual deaths within the school itself. Also, this school building is now scheduled for demolition to make way for a new elementary school within the next three years.\n",
